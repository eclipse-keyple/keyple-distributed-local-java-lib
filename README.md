# Keyple Distributed Local Java Library

## Overview

The **Keyple Distributed Local Java Library** is one of the two main libraries provided by the **Keyple Distributed** solution (the other one is [Keyple Distributed Remote Java Lib](https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-distributed-remote-java-lib)).

It must be imported and used by the application installed on the terminal **having local access** to the smart card reader but wishes to delegate all or part of the ticketing processing to a remote application.

It uses the common library [Keyple Distributed Network Java Lib](https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-distributed-network-java-lib).
